<h2 id="introduction-to-computing">Introduction to Computing</h2>
<p>The point of this course is simply this:</p>
<center><i>At the end of this course, you should be able to do something useful in your own major.</i></center>
<p>We will be using the Python programming language. Python is extremely powerful - super powerful in fact - yet easy to use. Specifically, we will be using Python 3.7X. Installing all the right software is time consuming and instructions must be followed exactly.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-something-useful-mean">What does <em>something useful</em> mean?</h3>
<p>A large part of this course will relate to the processing of data. Perhaps some data format conversion, perhaps some analysis. Maybe some charting. The data, of course, can come from your own major later in your college career and off into your professional career.</p>
<h4 id="please-start-thinking-about...">Please start thinking about…</h4>
<p>Do you have some data from a previous class that you might want to bring in (and possibly share) that you (we) can practice with? No better way to make the content of this course personal to <em>you</em> than discovering new / easier ways to complete your own class projects.</p>
<h2 id="your-laptop">Your laptop</h2>
<p>The relative power of your laptop will <em>directly</em> bear upon your ability to do class work on your own device. It may very well be that you will need to use a classroom computer rather than your own device.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need at least 6 gigabytes of space available on your disk.</li>
<li>Your will work best with at least 8 gigabytes of memory. Four is somewhat workable but painful.</li>
<li><strong>It is critical that your operating system must be current</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A nearly current Windows 10 is required.</p>
<p>MacOS 10 is required. MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) is preferred but not required.</p>
<h3 id="installation-equates-to-my-frustration">Installation equates to (my) frustration</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the planets must align perfectly for installation to procede easily for the entire class. Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will all be trying to download large amounts at the same time over the same WiFi network. Downloading will be <em>slow</em>.</li>
<li>You have different OS’s with different versions of each installed. For an instructor, this is a <strong>nightmare</strong>. I assure you I, at least, <strong>will</strong> become frustrated and <strong>will</strong> swear like a sailor. The f-bomb is one of my basic food groups. <em>My frustration will be with <u>me</u> and <u>my</u> feelings of helplessness in trying to make things perfect for you</em>.</li>
<li>You have laptops of varying capability. See previous re: <strong>nightmare</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing is this: I carry the weight of responsibility for the entire class and I want things to be perfect - so yeah, I will get frustrated. What I ask of you as individuals is to be patient and tolerant. We’ll get it right (which may mean you’ll need to use a classroom computer).</p>
<h3 id="cost-of--required-software">Cost of  required software</h3>
<p>$0.00.</p>
<h2 id="text-book">Text Book</h2>
<p>Our textbook is found online. You must subscribe to it - it is not free (though it is far less than a traditional textbook):</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in or create an account at <a href="http://learn.zybooks.com">learn.zybooks.com</a></li>
<li>Enter zyBook code: CARTHAGECSC1100KivolowitzWinter2020</li>
<li>Subscribe</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensure that you use your @carthage.edu email address.</p>
<h2 id="absences">Absences</h2>
<p>There are 200 minutes in a week of Tuesday / Thursday classes during Fall and Spring. There are 180 minutes in a J Term day. Therefore, each J Term day is roughly equivalent to a week of classes. Missing any class will be a problem for you. Attendence will be taken daily. If you must be absent, please send me an email stating nothing more than which day you will be absent. A reason is <strong>not</strong> required.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Grades will be based upon the following (subject to change):</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td>Quizzes</td>

</tbody>
</table><p>Readings will come from zybooks (the electronic book). Quiz questions will come from a test bank prepared by zybooks so will be closely tied to the readings.  Together, information coming from zybooks accounts for 40 percent of your grade.</p>
<p>The remaining 60 percent will come from programming assignments.</p>

<h3 id="a-comment-about-equity-and-inclusion">A comment about equity and inclusion</h3>
<p>I completely subscribe and agree with the Carthage statements on equity and inclusion. See them <a href="https://www.carthage.edu/equity-inclusion/mission-statement/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="advising-and-accommodations">Advising and accommodations</h3>
<p>The Carthage Advising Center offers a variety of services and accommodations to students with disabilities, based on appropriate documentation, nature of disability, and academic need. In order to initiate services, students should meet with Diane Schowalter at the start of the semester to discuss reasonable accommodation. After meeting with Diane Schowalter, students in need of accommodations should also speak with individual faculty members from whom accommodations are sought to communicate their needs and make requests in a timely manner. If a student does not request accommodation or provide documentation, the faculty member is under no obligation to provide accommodations. You may contact Diane Schowalter at ext. 5802 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:dschowalter1@carthage.edu">dschowalter1@carthage.edu</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-accessibility">A note about accessibility</h3>
<p>Carthage College strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers due to your disability (including mental health, learning disorders and chronic medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options.  To establish reasonable accommodations, you also need to register with Diane Schowalter in Learning Accessibility Services (<a href="mailto:dschowalter1@carthage.edu">dschowalter1@carthage.edu</a>).</p>
<h3 id="academic-success-and-health">Academic Success and Health</h3>
<p>Good health can help you achieve academic success. The Health and Counseling Center (HCC) supports students by addressing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. All services are free and confidential and are provided by experienced and licensed professionals. Services are available to all full-time, undergraduate students.</p>
