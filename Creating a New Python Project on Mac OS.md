## Assumptions

This note assumes that both Python and VSCode are installed.

Confirm the presence of VSCode using Spotlight Search - start entering "Visual" and you should see Visual Studio Code as a choice. If it is not present, follow the direction found [here](./Installing%20Python%20on%20Mac%20OS.md).

Confirm the presence of the right version of Python by entering the Terminal and typing:

```text
python3 --version
```

You should get something like:

```text
Python 3.7.5
```

If you do not, follow the same link given above.

## Creat a new directory

### From finder

Upon opening a Finder window, you should be in your home directory. Click the "Action" gear. Click on "New Folder" and give the new folder a name. Try to avoid spaces, using underscores or dashes instead.

### From Terminal

Upon opening a Terminal window, you should be in your home directory. Type: 

```text
mkdir chooseafoldername
```

Try to avoid spaces, using underscores or dashes instead.

## Open VSCode

Use Spotlight Search, or click the VSCode icon in the Dock. From the Terminal (if you added the appropriate `alias` type: `code`.
