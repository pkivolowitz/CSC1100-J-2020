# Progress

## January 8

On this day:
* We learned how to purchase and enroll in the class textbook.
* We went over the syllabus and learned that we can use Google Calendar to make appointments with the Professor.
* We installed Python 3.7, VS Code and some of the libraries we need.
* The Mac instructions contained a broken link to `scipy`. This has been fixed.
* We learned about these data types: numbers, strings and Booleans.
* We are able to enter the command line on Windows and on the Mac.
* We are able to enter Python interactive on both platforms.
* We learned we can exit interactive Python using `exit()` or `^D` on the Mac or `^Z return` on Windows.
* On the Mac we learned we must use `python3` and `pip3` rather than `python` and `pip`.
* We learned about many operators including +, -, /, *, // and %.
* We learned about logical operators `and` and `or`.
* We saw the simplest forms of `print()` and learned that it is an example of a *function*.
* We saw a minimal example of writing a program in VS Code and running it from there.
* We saw a *flow chart*.
* We used flow charts to diagram three variations on an `if` statement.
* We examined one form a little more closely.

## January 9

On this day:
* We reviewed. 
* We wrote program "ages" which used `input()` and simple `if` statements.
* We wrote program "temperatures" which said snarky things about various temperature ranges and finally, converted the temperature into Celsius.
* We learned about `while` loops, using code examples, flow charts and RL examples.
* We retrofitted a `while` loop into the "temperatures" program.
* We learned how to print several "things" on one line using commas in a call to `print()`.
* We heard that feet, degrees (in a circle) and degrees Farenheit are completely made up and that meters, radians and degrees Celsius are real. We also heard about Kelvin. Degrees Kelvin are real too.
* Chapter 1 was assigned as homework.
* We demo'd a subchapter from the book.

## January 10

On this day we expect:

* To learn about `random`
* To write a program to play the higher lower game
* To learn about lists:
    * Making and empty list
	* Adding to a list using `append`
	* Getting the length of a list using `len`
	* Indexing into a list
	* Slicing a list
	* Making a list from `range`
	* Shuffling a list
* To learn the `for` loop
* To write a program to print out a hand of 5 playing cards
* Chapter 2 will be assigned for over the weekend.
