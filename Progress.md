# Progress

## January 8

On this day:
* We learned how to purchase and enroll in the class textbook.
* We went over the syllabus and learned that we can use Google Calendar to make appointments with the Professor.
* We installed Python 3.7, VS Code and some of the libraries we need.
* The Mac instructions contained a broken link to `scipy`. This has been fixed.
* We learned about these data types: numbers, strings and Booleans.
* We are able to enter the command line on Windows and on the Mac.
* We are able to enter Python interactive on both platforms.
* We learned we can exit interactive Python using `exit()` or `^D` on the Mac or `^Z return` on Windows.
* On the Mac we learned we must use `python3` and `pip3` rather than `python` and `pip`.
* We learned about many operators including +, -, /, *, // and %.
* We learned about logical operators `and` and `or`.
* We saw the simplest forms of `print()` and learned that it is an example of a *function*.
* We saw a minimal example of writing a program in VS Code and running it from there.
* We saw a *flow chart*.
* We used flow charts to diagram three variations on an `if` statement.
* We examined one form a little more closely.
