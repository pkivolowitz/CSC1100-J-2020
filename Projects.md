## Project 1 - Make a nicer graph of gold prices

In class we wrote a program to create a basic plot of a csv file containing gold prices. 

You assignment is to make the graph "prettier". You will have to research how to implement the new requirements
found here on your own. This is on purpose - i.e. this research on your own is the nugget of the project.

You must add the following features:

* make your graph use `fivethirtyeight` style

* add a title to the whole graph

* add a legend to the graph - this is the little box that shows what each line is

* change the line style to dashed lines

* add markers to the line

To receive full credit you must add at least some meaningful header comments which must include things like:

* Your name

* A name for the program

* A very short description of the program

* A long description of the program

Further:

* Your program must use `sys.argv` to get the file name - in class we allowed hard coding the file name.

You must hand in your `.py` file via Schoology.

### Due Date
