# Times table

In this program you're get practice with lists, `for` loops and print formatting.

## Outline

1. Make a list from a `range` that includes the numbers 1 through 10.
2. Print a heading (of the numbers 1 through 10 with some spacing).
3. Make an outer loop that iterates over the list (use this for the row)
4. Print the left-hand row heading.
5. Make an inner loop that iterates over the list (use this for the column)
6. Form the product and print them nicely but don't print new lines
7. At the end of each line, print a new line
