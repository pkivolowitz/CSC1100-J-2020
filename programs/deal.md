# Dealing a hand

This program provides practice using:

* lists
* `random.shuffle()`
* `if`
* `for`
* coding logical steps

## Write a program

Write a program that shuffles a deck of playing cards and deals out 5 cards.

### The deck

How to represent a deck of playing cards? How about a list of the integers from 0 to 51?

### Shuffling

Once you have a list of integers from 0 to 51, using `random.shuffle()`.

### Performing a loop 5 times

Use a `for` loop coupled with `range()`.


### Converting 0 through 51 into cards

Printing "8" isn't satisfying! We want instead something like "7 of Diamonds". How to do this?

Hints:

* `if` / `elif`
* string concatenation
* `//`
* `%`
